        question: "I just booked my appointment online, should I call the clinic to confirm my appointment?",
        answer: "Please do not call to confirm appointments that have already been confirmed via email. Once you have your 9 digit code, this appointment is confirmed."

        question: "Can I bring somebody to my appointment?",
        answer: "Yes, you can as we want all of our patients to be comfortable when using our services. Please do bear in mind that during the Coronavirus pandemic, you should consider whether it's really necessary to be accompanied as we also have trained clinic staff who will be more than happy to chaperone your appointment."
